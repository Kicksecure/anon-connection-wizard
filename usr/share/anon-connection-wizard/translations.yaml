            <p>Press "Next" and try and fix the problem as per the instructions, or as a last resort,

        no_torrc:
            <p>The Tor config file does not exist.</p>
            <p>You can try to manually create it. Open it&#58;
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> System -> Tor User Config</blockquote>
            And add.
            <blockquote>#DisableNetwork 0</blockquote>
            Save. Then re-run anon-connection-wizard.</p>

        bad_torrc:
            <p>The line "DisableNetwork 0" does not exist in the Tor config file.</p>
            <p>You can try to manually edit the Tor config file&#58;
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> System -> Tor User Config</blockquote>
            <p>Add line containing only "DisableNetwork 0" (without the quotes),
            and re-run anon-connection-wizard.</p>

        cannot_connect:
            <p>"sudo service tor@default status" returned non-zero exit code , which means Tor does NOT work.</p>
            <p>Maybe your Whonix-Gateway has only one network card attached? Most likely there
            is something wrong with your Tor config.</p>
            <p>You can try to manually edit the Tor config file&#58; </p>
            <blockquote>Start Menu -> System -> Tor User Config</blockquote>
            <p>Running&#58; </p>
            <blockquote>sudo service tor@default restart</blockquote>
            <p>might help with troubleshooting.</p>
