"""
Supports communication with sockets speaking the Tor control protocol. This
allows us to send messages as basic strings, and receive responses as
:class:`~stem.response.ControlMessage` instances.

**This module only consists of low level components, and is not intended for
users.** See our `tutorials <tutorials.html>`_ and `Control Module
<api/control.html>`_ if you're new to Stem and looking to get started.

With that aside, these can still be used for raw socket communication with
Tor...

**Module Overview:**

::

  ControlSocket - Socket wrapper that speaks the tor control protocol.
    |- ControlPort - Control connection via a port.
    |  |- get_address - provides the ip address of our socket
    |  +- get_port - provides the port of our socket
    |
    |- ControlSocketFile - Control connection via a local file socket.
    |  +- get_socket_path - provides the path of the socket we connect to
    |
    |- send - sends a message to the socket
    |- recv - receives a ControlMessage from the socket
    |- is_alive - reports if the socket is known to be closed
    |- is_localhost - returns if the socket is for the local system or not
    |- connect - connects a new socket
    |- close - shuts down the socket
    +- __enter__ / __exit__ - manages socket connection

  send_message - Writes a message to a control socket.
  recv_message - Reads a ControlMessage from a control socket.
  send_formatting - Performs the formatting expected from sent messages.
